Vessel is a starter template that puts [Svelte](http://www.svelte.dev) and [Sails](http://www.sailsjs.com) together with [Docker](http://www.docker.com). It's a fun setup for making apps quickly with plenty of room to grow.

## Usage

##### As of now, there are no built-in methods for deployment. This is mainly meant as a development environment setup.

### Grab this repository and `cd` into whatever folder you put it into
```shell
npx degit nemo-omen/vessel#main mycoolproject
```

```shell
cd mycoolproject
```

### Install the dependencies
```shell
make install
```
Runs a Makefile that installs dependencies from both the main project folder
and the `api` folder wile using `docker-compose` to create a volume for the 
dockerized dev environment that comes with running the next step.

Alternatively, if you don't want to work in a dockerized environment, you can 
`npm install` once in the main directory, and once in the `/api` directory.

### Run the app in development
```shell
make dev
```
Runs `docker-compose --remove-orphans` without all the typing, setting up a dev environment

One day I may put all of the base project files into a container, we'll see.

If you're forgoing the virtual docker environment, you can also run `npm run all`
from the project's root directory.

#### Your app will be available at two addresses:

##### Backend: 
localhost:1337 => _Sails default_

##### Frontend:
localhost:5000 => _Svelte default_

### Don't forget to clean up after yourself
```shell
make down
# runs `docker-compose down` so you don't have volumes and images laying around everywhere
```
## Config
Default Sails config _mostly_ matches what you would get if you were to run `sails new <appname> --no-frontend`. Some changes have been made in order to make development faster.

### mongodb
You'll want to update the configured mongodb settings located in `/api/config/datastores.js`. Currently the default is set to `sails-mongodb` and the url is `mongodb://mongo/test`. If you like things to be super-easy, just change `test` to whatever you want you database to be named.

The `docker-compose.yml` included in this project spins up a mongo image, which is exposed at port `27018` rather than the default port of `27017`. This is to keep it from conflicting with any local mongo instances.

This mongo container is then accessed via `mongodb://mongo/<databasename>`

### Sails blueprint auto routes are on by default
You can change these settings in `/api/config/blueprints.js`.

Sails `config.blueprints.actions` and `config.blueprints.rest` are enabled by default. That means if you navigate to the `/api` folder and run `sails generate api hats` you'll be able to access the api at conventional REST endpoints:

GET: `http://localhost:1337/hats` -> returns all hats

GET: `http://localhost:1337/hats/abcdefg123` -> returns one hat

POST: `http://localhost:1337/hats` -> creates a hat, returns the created document

PATCH: `http://localhost:1337/hats/abcdefg123` -> updates a hat, returns the updated document

PUT: `http://localhost:1337/hats/abcdefg123` -> updates a hat, returns the updated document -- but Sails will tell you it prefers you to use `PATCH`

DELETE: `http://localhost:1337/hats/abcdefg123` -> deletes a hat, returns the deleted document

### Models config
You can change these settings in `/api/config/models.js`

Again, the defaults here have been set to get up and running as quickly as possible.

`schema: false` can be changed to `true` when you want to start validating any data coming through.

`migrate: alter` can be changed according to what you need. I don't know enough about Sails to mess with it yet.

All newly created documents will have the following attributes added automatically, you can change the attributes you want to include as needed:

```js
createdAt: { type: 'number', autoCreatedAt: true, },
updatedAt: { type: 'number', autoUpdatedAt: true, },
id: { type: 'string', columnName: '_id' },
```

## Realtime REST
### (the good stuff)
Because Sails automatically maps websocket calls made through the `sails.io` connection, realtime updates of your data are super-easy.

Here's one way to do it:
```js
import { onMount } from 'svelte';
import { socket } from './socket.js' //this is the connection set up at the root of the Svelte app

$: hats = []; // a nice, reactive, but empty, array to hold all your hats

async function updateHats() {
    // Sails maps REST verbs to methods on the sails.io.socket
    // so, if you emit 'get' on the socket, with the route you want to get hats from
    // Sails will give you what you're looking for over the websocket connection

    socket.get('/hats', (body, response) => {
        hats = [...body];
    });
}

//Sails will emit messages when anything happens to one of your blueprint models
// so, listening for changes on the name of your blueprint model, in this case 'hats',
// and calling the updateHats() function when changes happen should ensure data is synced
socket.on('hats', () => {
    updateHats();
})

// update the hats when the component mounts
onMount(() => {
    updateHats();
});
```
## So, why Sails?
Aside from the ability to prototype an app really, really quickly, Sails enables some freedom that something like Meteor doesn't â€” simple, custom socket messages. Feathers would probably be okay for this as well but I, personally, had some difficulty matching the code in their documentation to the code their CLI was generating.

The documentation on the Sails site can take a little while to get through, but it's on-point.

And then there's the documentation on the code that Sails generates for you. It's just amazing. I don't think I've seen more thoroughly documented code. Kudos to the good people at Sailsjs!

## Notes to self
### Things that might work to make this better:

[grunt-rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-rollup) - there might be a way to use this to integrate Svelte with the Sails app

[Svelte Server-side component API](https://svelte.dev/docs#Server-side_component_API) - maaaaybe.

[Full stack development starter](https://medium.com/swlh/full-stack-development-starter-svelte-and-express-831aefee41c0) - might be able to do this.

[Express Svelte template](https://github.com/somi92/express-svelte-template) - might be able to follow somi92's lead

[Svelte View Engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-view-engine) - maaaaybe.

### or

Just bundle the Svelte app into the `assets/` directory
